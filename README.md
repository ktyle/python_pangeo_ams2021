# python_pangeo_ams2021
This repository contains notebooks used in the final hour (Pangeo) of the [Python for Climate and Meteorology AMS Online Course 2021](https://damienirving.github.io/2021-03-02-ams/).

### Prerequisites: please use conda install to add the following packages to the environment you have been using for the short course so far:

fsspec intake-esm zarr tqdm nc-time-axis gcsfs s3fs

## You can run notebooks 01 and 03 via the Pangeo Binder service at the link below. Notebook 02, which has a greater
memory requirement than the Binder instance can provide, will not run in its entirety.
